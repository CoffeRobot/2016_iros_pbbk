Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature
Growing interest in binary descriptor due to performance requirements
Benchmarks for homography but not clear more appropriate for tracking

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sec:introduction}

Local regions of interest or keypoint descriptors are widely used in Computer Vision for application such as object recognition and retrieval, 3D reconstruction and motion tracking. (Speak about sift here and its computational cost) A constant increase of the resolution of cameras and the growing number of portable camera enabled devices with weak computational capabilities steered the attention of the Computer Vision community on extremely fast key-point detectors and binary descriptors that can dramatically decrease the computational cost of detecting and matching feature descriptors. (BRISK ORB). This kind of descriptor started to be used used in real time tacking system. However the improved performance comes at the cost of a decreased precision. (Introduce akaze here)

Given this growing interest in fast descriptors, the relevant questions are which descriptor is the most suited for tracking by detection and whether the choice of the descriptor depends on other factors, e.g resolution of the video. (Question here, is the high precision really important for tracking, is it sufficient to have a weaker descriptor? Which one is the best?)


The evaluation is performed in the context of tracking an object by detection its distinctive features. 

The test data includes a set of videos that present different light conditions, partial and total occlusion. 

The evaluation criterion are two-fold. First the feature descriptors are evaluated in terms of recall-precision, the number of correct and false matches within the ground truth bounding box. Second each feature descriptor is integrated in the same 2D tracker to estimate the bounding box of the object and the precision is computed in terms of low,medium and high requirements as explained in \cite{}.

The main contributions of this work are an extensive evaluation of the different feature descriptors for tracking purposes. Furthermore we provide a GPU implementation of the recent and popular akaze descriptor.
