\section{Conclusion}

We proposed an evaluation of the most common feature descriptors for the purpose of tracking by detection. Our experiments have shown that most of the feature descriptors have comparable results. While AKAZE and SIFT have proven to be more distinctive, ORB and BRISK compensate their weak descriptors with a higher number of points extracted. The employment of descriptors like AKAZE and SIFT in real time frameworks is viable only using GPUs. Therefore, given the growing interested in AKAZE descriptor, we provided a GPU implementation. Even if the computation of non linear filtering technique is more demanding than Gaussian filtering and not very suited for GPU's architecture, our results have shown that benefit of the extracting and matching a binary descriptor compensates the more demanding detection step. The code to perform the benchmark, the dataset and our implementation of AKAZE will be publicly available in order to ease researches in this area.
