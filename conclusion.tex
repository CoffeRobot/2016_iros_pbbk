\section{Conclusion}

We performed an evaluation of the most common feature descriptors for the purpose of tracking by detection. Our experiments have shown that most of the feature descriptors have comparable results on a dataset presenting challenges like motion blur, occlusion, scale, rotation and light changes. AKAZE and SIFT have proven to be more distinctive with small object transformation and motion blur. AKAZE seems to be particularly sensitive to scale changes. On the other hand ORB and BRISK have better performance on sequences with significant motion blur. Given the growing interested in AKAZE descriptor, we implemented the method using CUDA and evaluated the impact of a non-linear filtering techniques, not particularly suited for a GPU's architecture, on the performance of the AKAZE feature descriptor. Our results have shown that benefit of the extracting and matching a binary descriptor compensates the more demanding detection step achieving similar performances of the implementation of SIFT on the GPU. All the code to perform the benchmark, the dataset and our implementation of AKAZE will be publicly available in order to ease researches in this area.
