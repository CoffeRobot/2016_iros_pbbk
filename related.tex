AKAZE: By means of nonlinear diffusion, we can increase repeatability and distinctiviness when detecting and describing an image region at different scale levels through a nonlinear scale space. 

In 2005, Mikolajczyk et al. [9] evaluated affine region detectors, and looked to define the repeatability and accuracy of several affine covariant region detectors
